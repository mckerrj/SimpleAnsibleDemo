## This is a very simple Ansible Demo based on some of the examples in Jeff Geerling's book, Ansible for Devops.  It's a fantastic book.  Get it.
  - Vagrant file for setting up 3 systems
  - Hosts file for mapping hosts to actions
  - A Playbook for installing NTP on all three servers
  - A Playbook for installing django on just the "app" servers
  - A Playbook for installing mariadb on just the DB server and configuring iptables using the IPTables module.  A good example of how to use
  a module instead of a command.  The original command is right in the playbook.
